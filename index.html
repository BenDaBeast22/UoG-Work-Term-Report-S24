            time at the University of Guelph. Currently as of May 2024, I have completed my third co-op work term at a
            campsite reservation company called Camis as a software developer. In the future I plan to compile a
            homepage to link together all of my work term reports. As of right now my previous work term report can be

            Camis is a park management and campsite reservation company that offers a customizable solution for
            government parks that for over 40 years has met the needs of hundreds of customers spanning from Canada to
            the United States.

          <div class="left-align-p">
            <p>
              &emsp; At Camis, I was employed as a software developer on the web squad team. The Web Squad team is
              primarily responsible for working on the front facing feature of the Camis product Prime and Sprit. Prime
              is the campground reservation website used by customers to reserve and manage their campsites.
              <em>Below is an image of the campground reservation website for Parks Canada:</em>
            </p>

            <span class="image featured info-image"><img src="images/parksCanada.png" alt="" /></span>

            <p>
              &emsp;Alternatively, Spirit is used by call centers at campgrounds for bookings by phone and for park
              management like selling products at the shop. Furthermore, Spirit also has a content management systems
              built in where the solution can be configured for the customer. For instance in the image of Prime above
              for Parks Canada you can see that they offer Front Country Camping, Parks Accomadations, Backcountry and
              Day Use reservations. When I joined the team our team was finishing up a brand new feature called
              Waitlist. This feature was essentially a lottery where customers could win a reservation at a campsite.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;Afterwards our team worked on a variety of smaller UX initiatives such as upgrading the date picker
              calendar, improving the colour accesability on the map (where users choose which campsite to book), making
              search fields optional, adding guest check-out and writing end to end tests using Playwright. Throughout
              the work-term, I primarily worked on the campground reservation website Prime which is built using
              Angular. Since, I used Angular during my first work-term at Hatch I was able to quickly adapt and start
              getting my hands dirty in completing more difficult tasks. As my co-op is 8 months, in the next work-termI
              hope to work more on Spirit the call center and content management system built using the .Net Framework
              and C# to further expand my skillset.

          <div class="sub-header-container">
            <p>
              During the work term I came up with <em>3 learning goals</em> that I believed would make me a better
              software developer in the future and would help enhance my abilities in areas that I was missing from
              University. The <em>3 goals</em> were to:
            </p>

            <div class="list-container">
              <ol>
                <li>Improve my technical skills in Angular, RXJS and NGRX</li>
                <li>Have a good understanding of the Camis Solution</li>
                <li>Improve my time management skills</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="goals-explained">
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #1</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;During my co-op workterm, I wanted to improve my technical literacy in working with Angular, RXJS
                and NGRX. Even though I learned Angular during my first co-op at Hatch I was only a beginner. By
                continuing to improve in Angular and some of the more difficult technologies it uses will become a more
                seasoned Angular and front-end developer able to tackle harder tasks.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To achieve my goal of becoming proficient these technologies I read documentation on RXJS and NGRX
                and worked on some tickets that used them. For instance, I worked on a ticket that allowed campers to
                self-check themselves out of the campsite instead of having to manually go to the call-center and
                check-out. This required having an understanding of some of the NGRX state management going and using a
                lot of RXJS functions to update the reservation as being checked-out.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the workterm I became much more familiar with Angular, RXJS and NGRX and was able to
                complete more difficult tickets with hight story points that required a deeper understanding.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #2</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;My second goal during the work term was to better understand the Camis solution. Specifically, I
                wanted to focous on understanding the intricacies of the web reservation solution Prime, since I would
                be working mostly, on the front-end to complete my first goal.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To achieve my goal of improving my understanding of Prime, I worked on a variety of different
                tickets and asked questions to my teammates when I was stuck. I collaborated with every teammate who
                speacialized in different areas on at least one ticket and this helped me sharpen my understanding of
                Primes complications. Moreover, I reviewed teammates PRs to understand their work and did a lot of self
                testing and exploring of how our website worked.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the workterm I greatly deepened my comprehension of Prime and as a result was able
                to offer more insight to my teammates in the planning, estimating and sprint review meetings.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #3</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;The final goal I wanted to achieve this work-term was to improve my time management skills in
                order to become a more valuable member to the team. I'm often a person who hyper focuses on a single
                goal until it is complete. However, to be a good web developer team member it's essential to be able to
                switch to more important tasks, answer questions from other squades,review others work and find time to
                communicate with the team to ensure all of the work in the sprint gets done and that our team
                efficiently handles any problems from the software that arise.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To improve my time management skills I tried to split up my day to find time to do each task. For
                instance, at the start and end of each day I would check the channels for bugs or people asking for help
                as well as review teammates PRs. Whereas, during the middle of the day I would work on a task and then
                take breaks where I would again check channels or reflect on whether I needed any help to promptly
                finish my tickets.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the work-term by effectively managing my time I was able to become a better team
                player at doing work besides working on my own tickets and as a result our teams velocity increased.

              &emsp;For the focus of my report, the topic I am going to write about is my experience working on a team
              as a part of web-squad and its interactions with the other teams at Camis. This is the first co-op where I
              worked on a large team of people working in the same speacialization as me web-development. I will start
              by explaining the roles of everyone on the team and how all the teams at Camis function as a whole. Then I
              will move into the development cycle for our team and finally, I will discuss some problems our team faced
              and some improvements that could be made to our team as well as its relations to the other teams and
              management.

            <p>
              &emsp;At Camis there are a variety of different teams such as web-squad(my team), field-squad,
              payment-squad, QA, devops and IT. Every team was made up of a different size and had one co-op student
              working on the team. My team was made up of 9 people including me. And on our team each member had a
              niche. Our team lead focoused on difficult tickets requiring more input from higher ups. Two of the
              developers(Oleks and Julian) specialized working on Spirit and the backend technologies. Another two
              developers(Alicia and Amninder) specialized in Prime. Nihar was a jack of both trades and worked on a bit
              of both. Denice was our UI and UX specialist. Tom And finally, Keith was involved in the testing side of
              our teams work. Our team was very flexible and had the skills to be able to work on most initiatives
              higher-ups were pushing. Every team at Camis for the most part worked seperately on different projects.
              Our team due to working on the most front facing features however, worked a bit differently from other
              other teams since we had to work on many bugs on the fly that users reported in a timely manner. Moreover,
              contrary to the other teams certain devs would pick up specific tickets. Other teams had members with
              similar skillsets and worked on any available tasks. The projects that a team were assigned to was decided
              by higher-ups and the timeline for getting them done was based on the contract due dates with the
              different parks. Again our team was a bit different in that we had a UI/UX specialist who created projects
              to improve our websites such as improving our reservation calendar, improving the reservation maps colour
              accessability and so on.

              <em>Development Cycle</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;Every week on Tuesday, the team met up in a meeting on Microsoft Teams led by the Project Manager.
              There the Project Manager led the discussion and checked on each sections progress. At the end of the
              meeting we would set timelines for the next set of tasks we needed to complete and adjust our timeline
              based on how each section was progressing. This meeting also served as a good time to ask teammates in
              different sections questions and to schedule meetings with them. In my own section everyday I had a
              standup meeting with the Software Lead who I worked very closely with. There, we discussed the tasks we
              worked on previously and what we were planning on working on. He was always available to lend me help with
              anything I was working on. At Brock all new employees also had someone known as a Talent Manager. The
              Talent Manager is reponsible for overseeing your career progress and also serves as a point of contact to
              talk about anything. I met with him weekly about how my work was going on the project. He was also
              involved on the Software side of the project, and sometimes dropped into the standup meetings to help out.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp;This schedule of weekly meetings and daily standups is generally what happened for most of the work
              term. On the software side our main milestones included: setting up new servers with all our new software,
              configuring the devices and alarms for the new databases, and preparing for all of the tests in the FAT
              plan. Everything generally went smoothly, but we ended up having to push the FAT back an extra week due to
              issues that took Controls longer than expected. A couple weeks before the FAT, we had a progress meeting
              with a couple of higher up employees who checked on how our project was going. They gave us a few more
              suggestions of what we should touch up on before the FAT. Then, the week before the FAT we did 2
              rehearsals for the FAT to ensure that we were prepared to give a good presentation to the client without
              any technical difficulties or bugs. When it came time for the actual FAT everything went very smoothly and
              we were able to finish it and get it signed by the client within 1 day.

              <em>Project Challenges</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;The biggest challenge that our team ran into on the project is the imbalance of team members in
              different sections. Namely, there was only one person working on the Controls team. This ended up being a
              problem because there was a lot of work on the Controls side that needed to be done. As a result, this
              sometimes held up our work on the Software side. For example, during the testing phase of the project
              before the FAT, only parts of the Automod Simulation were available at a time to be tested. Due to this
              imbalance, our time was being used less effectively on the Software side, and overall we could have
              finished our tasks approximately 2 weeks earlier had Controls been able to finish their tasks at the same
              speed as us.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp;Another significant challenge our team faced, is the fact that we were working in different
              locations. During my work term, my Talent Manager and I lived near the Kitchener office in Waterloo.
              However, the rest of the team was located in the Vancouver office. Moreover, the majority of employees at
              Brock including myself worked remotely most of the time. This made it increasingly difficult to get in
              touch and collaborate with certain teammates. For instance, when I was going through the test plan using
              the Automod simulator it broke quite often. If we were working in the same location it would be much
              easier to get help to fix the issue and continue my work. To make things even more difficult, there is a
              3-hour time difference between Kitchener and Vancouver. So it was often difficult to get in contact with
              my teammates working in the Vancouver office.

            <p>
              &emsp;The first improvement I would make to the project lifecycle would be having another person on
              Controls so that the whole team would be balanced. As I mentioned, this would have greatly improved our
              effectiveness on the Software team, since we often had to wait for controls to continue with our main
              tasks. Likely, if there had been another Controls Engineer working on the project, we could have been
              finished 1 week before the FAT rather than having to push it back an extra week.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp;The second improvement I would make to the project lifecycle is if possible having everybody working
              at the same location. This solves the time difference problem, and makes it very easy to work together and
              get in contact with others on the team. Furthermore, by working in the same office our team could have
              developed more chemistry and used more teamwork to complete tasks more efficiently. In the case that
              working at the same location is not possible, there should be someone from every section in each person's
              location/timezone who could serve as a good point of contact to ask for help. This would have greatly
              improved our teams' efficiency and reduced the amount of waiting time to solve tasks that require outside
              help.

          <p>
            To conclude, my co-op term at Brock Solutions was an incredible learning experience for me. It was the first
            time that I worked on a real world project to completion, and it was the first time that I worked on a
            project that required knowledge of such a big system with so many moving parts. Working on the Kahului
            Airport re-control project I learned about how Brock Solutions airport sortation software worked, I improved
            my skills at working with servers and databases, I used a bunch of Brocks custom tools, and I prepared and
            presented tests to show off our finished product in front of a client. On the project our team did face some
            challenges due to an imbalance of peronnel on the Controls team and due to working remotely in different
            timezones and locations. However, we were able to overcome these challenges and this experience taught me
            about some of the difficulties of working remotely. My takeaway is that it is vastly better for employees on
            a team to live nearby, and have the ability to work in the same office. Nonetheless, the project ended up
            going well and I had a great experience working on the project at Brock!
