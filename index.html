              &emsp;To get a more detailed account of my role at Camis, the main solutions they offer and what I worked
              on during my last term see my previous work-term report:
              <em
                ><a class="link" href="https://bendabeast22.github.io/UoG-Work-Term-Report-W24/" target="”_blank”"

                >.
              </em>
              In brief, Camis has a campsite reservation website called Prime and an application for call centers to
              make reservations and customize Prime(business rules, content, styles, etc) to the clients needs called
              Spirit. During my second term at Camis I still ended up working mostly working on the frontend on Prime
              using Angular. I worked on fixing a lot of bugs. For instance users not being able to proceed past certain
              pages, page responsiveness issues, or failing race conditions. I also worked on improving our UX/UI. For
              example I worked on improving our booking category navigation (used for searching for different types of
              products) experience for mobile. Before users had to click on pagination buttons to view overflowing
              booking categories. It looked like this for desktop (I don't have a screenshot for mobile):
            </p>

            <span class="image featured info-image"><img src="images/parksCanada.png" alt="" /></span>

            <p>
              &emsp;In this ticket I made the navigation scrollable, improved its styling, and changed the icons from
              images to font awesome icons that could be customized from content management.
              <em>Below is a video of the improved booking category naviation experience for mobile:</em>

              </video>
            </div>

            <p>
              &emsp;Another example of a ticket I worked on is adding a back button to all of our booking work flows that
              works with the stepper component to return the user to the correct page.

            <p>
              &emsp;During the majority of the second half of my work term our team was tasked with ensuring that Prime
              was certified for passed all of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG). An external organization 
              reviewed and created tickets for everything they believed violated these guidelines. This ended up taking 
              up about half of our teams capacity for sprints. I'll talk further about this struggle for our team 
              in my report focus. Furthermore, our team was trying to switch from Test Cafe to Playwright to improve our 
              integration testing performance which also took some commitment each sprint. Another initiative our team starting working on towards the end was improving our online
              store. Prime was mainly built for the purpose of campground reservation so our store experience for purchasing
              products had a lot to be improved.

              For my second term at Camis I made <em>3 learning goals</em> I believed would make me a better software
              developer in the future and would help enhance my abilities in areas that I was missing from University.
              The <em>3 goals</em> were to:
            </p>

            <div class="list-container">
              <ol>
                <li>Improve my leadership skills</li>
                <li>Improve my presentation and oral communication skills</li>
                <li>Improve my teamwork skills</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="goals-explained">
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #1</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;During my co-op work term, I wanted to improve my leadership skills by sharing my opinion more in
                meetings, actively participating in solving problems that came up during sprint planning and by fixing
                bugs our team faces. Since this is my second term at my current co-op, I had a much better understanding
                of our organization and I believed I hand the ability to start becoming a leader on our team.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To be a better leader I more freely gave my opinon on issues our team faced, especially during our
                teams retro. For instance, a big issues our team faced in an influx of tickets from an outside company
                for accessibility. I explained what I believed to be the best solution to this problem. To create our
                own tickets for each workflows accessibility rather than try and resolve the hundereds of tickets
                created by the outside company. However, I still didn't have as much knowledge as other more experienced
                members in terms of solutions for tickets during backlog refinement so I didn't provide much leadership
                in those meetings.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the work-term, I took a step forward in improving my leadership skills. I more
                freely gave my opinion on issues our team faced, especially during retro.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #2</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;My second goal during the work term was to improve my presentation and oral communication skills.
                This goal was important to me since I have trouble explaining complicated issues and presenting in front
                of other people well. I have trouble in this area due to not being able to effectively organize my
                thoughts before speaking.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To achieve this goal I planned on taking bullet point notes before presenting ideas to my team in
                meetings and before our bi-weekly sprint review meeting where we show off the tickets we worked on to
                higher-ups in the company. However, in practice I didn't end up doing this. When I had issues I found it
                much easier to ask for help 1 on 1 and <em>show rather than tell</em> what problems I was facing. In
                addition, I found it worked better for me to express my issues and post them in squad chat rather than
                verbally since this allowed me to get my thoughts in order and be more comprehensible. On the other
                hand, during sprint review meetings my presentation skills didn't notable improve since the
                presentations were very straightforward without much engagement from the audience. Rather than a demo of
                the feature we worked on, it ended up being more of a check to make sure we did the ticket correctly.
                The presentaion was just to show that the ticket met the acceptance criteria.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;Thus, by the end of the workterm my communication and presentation skills didn't improve much.
                However, I found better methods of getting help when I was stuck by opting to meet 1 on 1 with teammates
                more experienced in an issue I was facing, or by writing out my problem in the chat which allowed me to
                get me thoughts in order, and explain myself clearly and concisely.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #3</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;The final goal I wanted to achieve this work term was to improve my teamwork skills at working
                with other developers to complete tickets. Naturally, I like to work alone in general. This has been the
                case for most of my education as well. And during my program in Computer Science at University of Guelph
                most assignments and assessments are entirely individual. Even during the software group project course
                even though we worked as a group to achieve a goal I mostly worked alone on my individual parts to
                achieve that goal.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;I ended up doing a pretty good job of completing this goal. By the end of the term, I worked with
                the majority of members on my team on different types of tickets. I reached out to teammates I believed
                had expertise in an area when I was stuck and for confirmation on the work I had done. Nevertheless, I
                could have done better reaching out sooner for help and there were a couple teammates that I didn't work
                closely with during my time at Camis.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the work-term by working with most of my teammates I become a better team player and
                as a result our teams velocity increased.

              &emsp;For the focus of my report, the topic I am going to write about the main issues and challenges our team faced
              this term and how I believe that we could solve them. I will finish off with some key takeaways I believe could help on 
              work teams I'm on in the future.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <em>Prime Accessibility Audit</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;
              One of the main challenges our team faced was making Prime accessible to pass the 
              upcoming accessibility audit. The issue was that an external organization created hundereds of tickets
              to fix — many of which were very minor — and they were completely unorganized. While I was there we 
              ended up trying to fill up half of our sprint with these tickets which took up most of ours teams capacity and 
              still wouldn't allow for us to meet the deadline for the audit.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;I believe a better solution would be for higher ups at Camis to have discussed beforehand this issue with our team
              before getting an external company to create all these tickets and perform the audit. Since we then would have been 
              able to solve this situation much more efficiently. A member on our team had previous experience at another company where 
              they had a much better orgainzation help them pass the accessibility audit and fix the critical issues. Alternatively, I believed 
              it would be much better for us to create our own tickets for fixing any accessibility issues in every major workflow and use 
              case for our website. Since, this way it would be much easier to seed out critical issues and it would be a much more organized 
              approach then the hundereds of tickets from the external organization. Either way, our team should have been more involved in deciding 
              the approach to completing the audit and its deadline so that we could complete the work without it taking up our entire sprints.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;My takeaway from this experience is that before higher-ups make decisions for large epics of work there should be a 
              meeting with the team involved. Since our team has more expertise in this area we can offer useful feedback to complete 
              tasks more efficiently.

              where we verified to higher-ups and people from other squads that our tickets met the acceptance criteria.
              I found this meeting to be a waste of time. Moreover, This goes against the integrity of the developer since 
              we already check that each ticket meets the acceptance criteria. Furthermore, the QA team tests and verifies this 
              as well. In the meetings, there was rarely any feedback and it felt like there was no value to most of the people there.
              Since we were just going over the acceptance criteria for individual tickets there was no connectedness and the bulk of people in the 
              meeting probably had no idea what was going on and weren't paying attention.

            <p>    
              &emsp;Instead what would have been more useful would be to have a monthly demo where each
              teams presents the features that they worked on for the last month. This way everyone in the company could
              have an idea of what each team is working on and it would be useful and exciting to the rest of the company.
              A demo would be much easier to follow and there would be enough bulk of work accomplished to show entire 
              big features finished.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;My takeaway from this experience is that every meeting should serve a purpose or be engaging
              to the audience. Furthermore, rather than having to follow along with higher-ups agendas, teams should be more agile 
              and have more of a say in their sprint schedule.

          <p>
            To conclude, during my second term at Camis I became more of a contributor on the team 
            and started to voice my opinions more openly. I became a better teammate and took steps towards becoming
            a better leader. Again I mostly worked on the front-end on Prime using 
            Angular and was much more efficient at finishing tickets.
            I worked on larger front-end features and fixed bugs more efficiently.
            During the second half of my term, our teams faced some challenges which I believed could have 
            handled better. We were tasked with passing an accessibility audit and higher-ups made questionable
            decisions without our teams opinions that caused us to be inefficient in achieving this goal. I believe 
            this could have been solved from giving our team more of a voice in how we approached the challenge at hand.
            Additionally, our bi-weekly sprint review meeting didn't work well for the organization and I believed it could be 
            an effective meeting by making it into a monthly demo for teams to showcase their work.
            Overall, despite the challenges, I had a great time working at Camis during my second term and working with the
            other developers on the web squad team!

            Thank you to everyone on the web-squad team! Everyone was very friendly and were always available to help me
            out when I was stuck and were happy to answer any questions I had. I felt like a proper member on the team
            and had the freedom to voice any thoughts that I had. Also it was good to get to know some of the other
            co-op students and discuss our experiences on different teams. We had some fun events in the second half of our 
            term such as the Camis Olympics where me and 3 other co-ops won a gold at building a tent the fastest.
