            time at the University of Guelph. Currently as of May 2024, I have completed my third co-op work term at a
            campsite reservation company called Camis as a software developer. In the future I plan to compile a
            homepage to link together all of my work term reports. As of right now my previous work term report can be

            Camis is a park management and campsite reservation company that offers a customizable solution for
            government parks that for over 40 years has met the needs of hundreds of customers spanning from Canada to
            the United States.

          <div class="left-align-p">
            <p>
              &emsp; At Camis, I was employed as a software developer on the web squad team. The Web Squad team is
              primarily responsible for working on the front facing feature of the Camis product Prime and Sprit. Prime
              is the campground reservation website used by customers to reserve and manage their campsites.
              <em>Below is an image of the campground reservation website for Parks Canada:</em>
            </p>

            <span class="image featured info-image"><img src="images/parksCanada.png" alt="" /></span>

            <p>
              &emsp;Alternatively, Spirit is used by call centers at campgrounds for bookings by phone and for park
              management like selling products at the shop. Furthermore, Spirit also has a content management systems
              built in where the solution can be configured for the customer. For instance in the image of Prime above
              for Parks Canada you can see that they offer Front Country Camping, Parks Accomadations, Backcountry and
              Day Use reservations. When I joined the team our team was finishing up a brand new feature called
              Waitlist. This feature was essentially a lottery where customers could win a reservation at a campsite.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;Afterwards our team worked on a variety of smaller UX initiatives such as upgrading the date picker
              calendar, improving the colour accesability on the map (where users choose which campsite to book), making
              search fields optional, adding guest check-out and writing end to end tests using Playwright. Throughout
              the work-term, I primarily worked on the campground reservation website Prime which is built using
              Angular. Since, I used Angular during my first work-term at Hatch I was able to quickly adapt and start
              getting my hands dirty in completing more difficult tasks. As my co-op is 8 months, in the next work-termI
              hope to work more on Spirit the call center and content management system built using the .Net Framework
              and C# to further expand my skillset.

          <div class="sub-header-container">
            <p>
              During the work term I came up with <em>3 learning goals</em> that I believed would make me a better
              software developer in the future and would help enhance my abilities in areas that I was missing from
              University. The <em>3 goals</em> were to:
            </p>

            <div class="list-container">
              <ol>
                <li>Improve my technical skills in Angular, RXJS and NGRX</li>
                <li>Have a good understanding of the Camis Solution</li>
                <li>Improve my time management skills</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="goals-explained">
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #1</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;During my co-op workterm, I wanted to improve my technical literacy in working with Angular, RXJS
                and NGRX. Even though I learned Angular during my first co-op at Hatch I was only a beginner. By
                continuing to improve in Angular and some of the more difficult technologies it uses will become a more
                seasoned Angular and front-end developer able to tackle harder tasks.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To achieve my goal of becoming proficient these technologies I read documentation on RXJS and NGRX
                and worked on some tickets that used them. For instance, I worked on a ticket that allowed campers to
                self-check themselves out of the campsite instead of having to manually go to the call-center and
                check-out. This required having an understanding of some of the NGRX state management going and using a
                lot of RXJS functions to update the reservation as being checked-out.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the workterm I became much more familiar with Angular, RXJS and NGRX and was able to
                complete more difficult tickets with hight story points that required a deeper understanding.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #2</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;My second goal during the work term was to better understand the Camis solution. Specifically, I
                wanted to focous on understanding the intricacies of the web reservation solution Prime, since I would
                be working mostly, on the front-end to complete my first goal.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To achieve my goal of improving my understanding of Prime, I worked on a variety of different
                tickets and asked questions to my teammates when I was stuck. I collaborated with every teammate who
                speacialized in different areas on at least one ticket and this helped me sharpen my understanding of
                Primes complications. Moreover, I reviewed teammates PRs to understand their work and did a lot of self
                testing and exploring of how our website worked.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the workterm I greatly deepened my comprehension of Prime and as a result was able
                to offer more insight to my teammates in the planning, estimating and sprint retrospective meetings.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Goal #3</strong>
              </h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                &emsp;The final goal I wanted to achieve this work-term was to improve my time management skills in
                order to become a more valuable member to the team. I'm often a person who hyper focuses on a single
                goal until it is complete. However, to be a good web developer team member it's essential to be able to
                switch to more important tasks, answer questions from other squades,review others work and find time to
                communicate with the team to ensure all of the work in the sprint gets done and that our team
                efficiently handles any problems from the software that arise.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;To improve my time management skills I tried to split up my day to find time to do each task. For
                instance, at the start and end of each day I would check the channels for bugs or people asking for help
                as well as review teammates PRs. Whereas, during the middle of the day I would work on a task and then
                take breaks where I would again check channels or reflect on whether I needed any help to promptly
                finish my tickets.
              </p>

              <p>
                &emsp;By the end of the work-term by effectively managing my time I was able to become a better team
                player at doing work besides working on my own tickets and as a result our teams velocity increased.

              &emsp;For the focus of my report, the topic I am going to write about is my experience working on a team
              as a part of web-squad and its interactions with the other teams at Camis. This is the first co-op where I
              worked on a large team of people working in the same speacialization as me web-development. I will start
              by explaining the roles of everyone on the team and how all the teams at Camis function as a whole. Then I
              will move into the development cycle for our team and finally, I will discuss some problems our team faced
              and some improvements that could be made to our team as well as its relations to the other teams and
              management.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <em>Preface</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;At Camis there are a variety of different teams such as web-squad(my team), field-squad,
              payment-squad, QA, devops and IT. Every team was made up of a different size and had one co-op student
              working on the team. My team was made up of 9 people including me. And on our team each member had a
              niche. Our team lead focoused on difficult tickets requiring more input from higher ups. Two of the
              developers(Oleks and Julian) specialized working on Spirit and the backend technologies. Another two
              developers(Alicia and Amninder) specialized in Prime. Nihar was a jack of both trades and worked on a bit
              of both. Denice was our UI and UX specialist. Tom And finally, Keith was involved in the testing side of
              our teams work. Our team was very flexible and had the skills to be able to work on most initiatives
              higher-ups were pushing.
            </p>

            <p>
              &emsp;Every team at Camis for the most part worked seperately on different projects. Our team due to
              working on the most front facing features however, worked a bit differently from other other teams since
              we had to work on many bugs on the fly that users reported in a timely manner. Moreover, contrary to the
              other teams certain devs would pick up specific tickets. Other teams had members with similar skillsets
              and worked on any available tasks. The projects that a team were assigned to was decided by higher-ups and
              the timeline for getting them done was based on the contract due dates with the different parks. Again our
              team was a bit different in that we had a UI/UX specialist who created projects to improve our websites
              such as improving our reservation calendar, improving the reservation maps colour accessability and so on.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <em>Development Cycle</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;The development cycle for our team at Camis consisted of sprint planning, backlog refinement, future
              planning sprint retrospective meetings, and finally sprint review. At Sprint Planning we would fill up our
              sprints with stuff at the top of the backlog thats our top priority and stop once everyone believed our
              team was at our capacity. Next, at backlog refinement we point all of our tickets that are ready using
              Planning Poker. Next, in the sprint retrospective we go over charts like the burndown chart. Then we
              collaborate on a retro board and each person adds sticky notes for went well and improvements that could
              be made for the sprint and discuss on the highest voted stickies. Next, in the future planning meetings we
              adjust the timeline in Jira of all the projects we are working on. Finally, during sprint review we demo
              each tickets acceptance criteria to ensure the work in the sprint was completed properly. On the daily, we
              have a standup meeting in the morning where we discuss our tickets in progress, any issues we are facing,
              and bring up important requests or questions in the different channels on Slack.
            </p>

              <em>Team Problems and Solutions</em>
              <hr />
            </h3>

            <p>
              &emsp;The biggest challenge that our team faced was a lack of communication with higher-ups and there
              being no accountability on projects. For example, when our team finished Waitlist a cutting edge feature
              and issues arose there were multiple different people in management roles sending different messages in
              different threads and this made it difficult to understand and come up with a proper fix to the issue.
              Moreover, there would sometimes be radio silence when the fix was done and our team was waiting for
              further guidance to apply it. The biggest issue we faced in Waitlist was that after the draw expired the
              statueses on the draw changed to incorrect statuses on the website which could cause confusion for
              customers who won and claimed their reservation. A list of emails for the customers affected was made and
              sent to the higher-ups to send to the call-centers to make a PR email. And our team made a database fix to
              the resolve the issue afterwards as well. However, there was a lot of miscommunication and confusion
              throughout our team of what management wanted, when they wanted it by and what they were doing behind the
              scenes to address the issue. After the database fix was made it took a couple days before we got a
              response that fix was actually deployed. In general whenever things got bad and there were issues,
              multiple higher-ups whitout proper context on the project would spam us with requests and the process to
              resolve them was very disorganized and stressful. Additionally, another problem was that for big projects
              like Waitlist there didn't seem to be much interest from management or other teams and when our supervisor
              would send data of how the draw was going we would only receive engagement from our own squad.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp;To fix this communication issue between our team and our customers. I think it would be beneficial
              to have someone in management who is accountable for big projects who is kept in the loop with our team
              and loops us in on any big issues that arise. This way there woudn't be a disorganized scramble to address
              problems that arise in production and additionally it would allow us to receive better feedback from the
              customer on the features we add.

            To conclude, my co-op term at Camis was an incredible learning experience for me. It was the first time I
            worked on such a large team and such a large web development solution. Working at Camis I learned how Prime
            their camground reservation solution and Sprit their call-center and content management solution worked.
            Moreover, I worked on a variety of different tasks and demoed my changes in the Sprint Review. I greatly
            improved my front-end skills in Angular and became a better teamplayer by the end of the term. Our team
            faced a few issues such as the lack of accountability on big projects. Since if there had been someone in
            charge of Wailist (the campsite revervation lottery project) then it would have been much easier to
            understand issues going on and how we should fix them. In spite of that our team was able to overcome this
            and successfully complete all of our projects and promptly respond to any ssues that occured. Overall I had
            a great time working at Camis and becoming a part of the web squad team.
